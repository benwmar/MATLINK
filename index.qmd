## Welcome

This site is designed to provide guidance, scripts and resources for sites transitioning data to OMOP common data model as part of CURE ID.

CURE ID is a platform designed and developed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Translational Sciences (NCATS) to capture real world data (RWD) about how existing drugs are used in new ways (e.g., drug repurposing) to treat diseases of high unmet clinical need. The documentation on this site is part of a project funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)'s Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (under Interagency Agreement #75F40121S35006) to develop and disseminate tools facilitating the extraction of RWD from the electronic health record (EHR).

## Introduction

The goals of OMOP are to gain better understanding of human health by improving our ability to analyze observational health data.

Health data is stored by individual health systems in unique ways which limits the ability to collaborate and learn from larger populations. This is a problem because certain clinical conditions are infrequent and it is important to have sufficient number of cases to perform statistical tests. De-identified data shared across institutions has the promise of allowing scientists to develop important insights about health which is the motivation to enable greater collaboration.

#### What is a common data model?

A common data model (CDM) allows multiple health care systems with their individual databases to join forces creating greater populations which can power more compelling scientific studies. A simple way to think about this is the difficulty of finding the silverware drawer in a new kitchen -- if there is a unifying rule for where the silverware drawer is located in every kitchen (immediately to right of the sink) it makes it possible to find this much easier. A common data model creates a system so that data elements like "systolic blood pressure" or "sepsis" are recorded and organized in the same way. OMOP stands for Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership and is the common data model of the [Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics](https://www.ohdsi.org/) program.

#### What is an ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. Essentially this is the process of mapping data from one system to another. Please see \[The Book of OHDSI, Chapter 6\] (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/ExtractTransformLoad.html).

## Getting started

The code for the CURE ID project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is a web-based platform that allows developers to host, review, and collaborate on code repositories. It is widely used for version control and source code management, and it provides features such as issue tracking, wikis, and project management tools to facilitate team collaboration.Â 

The repository containing the code and concept sets can be accessed at [OHDSI/CureIdRegistry](https://github.com/OHDSI/CureIdRegistry) There are four branches within the repository that differ only in the clinical variables included in the cohort curation scripts. Be sure to select the appropriate branch based on individual health system data and ETL capacity:

1.  Main branch: fundamental set of variables for Registry submission - demographics, comorbidities, vitals, labs, medications, vaccinations, oxygen devices, viral assays, and COVID complications.
2.  Refresh Basic: the main branch variables with additional concepts to allow for Charlson Comorbidity Index calculation
3.  Refresh Advanced: the refresh basic branch variables with additional concepts for Area Deprivation Index calculation (this branch requires Geocoding patient addresses to determine Census Blocks)
4.  Main CDM v5.3: this is the same set of variables included in the main branch but with cohort curation scripts written for the OMOP CDM version 5.3 (there are four fields names that changed from version 5.3 to 5.4)

### [OHDSI ETL Steps]{.underline}

1.  **Find your people.**

    a.  Assemble ETL team: both data experts, medical experts, CDM/vocabulary experts
    b.  Assign persons with medical knowledge to create code mappings
    c.  Assign persons with technical knowledge to implement the ETL
    d.  Schedule regular meetings for quality control maintenance

2.  **Understand your data.**

    a.  Take inventory of source data (tools: [White Rabbit](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit))
        i.  List of tables in database
        ii. List fields in each table
        iii. List distinct values of each field
        iv. Summarize the frequency of each value of each field.
    b.  Define relationships between source data tables and fields (tools: [Rabbit-in-a-Hat](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit))
        i.  Record both relationship definition decisions and reasoning behind these decisions
    c.  Determine standardized vocabularies that already exist in your source data (ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS, LOINC, etc.)
        i.  Many commonly used standardized coding systems have already been mapped to the OMOP vocabulary -- utilize the work done by others across the OHDSI community to accelerate the process of mapping your data systems to OMOP.
    d.  Determine the coding systems in your source data that are proprietary or not already mapped to OMOP (proprietary patient/visit identifiers, account numbers, charge codes, etc.)

3.  **Map your codes to OMOP concepts.**

    a.  Summarize the frequency of each code from your source data code sets that will require mapping to OMOP concepts.
    b.  Create your source data to OMOP mapping. (tools: [Usagi](https://github.com/OHDSI/Usagi))
        i.  Assign this task to the ETL team members with appropriate medical knowledge to discern which codes are most synonymous based on their descriptions. Medical knowledge is key for this step as semantic understanding of clinical descriptions is required to make decisions on mapping source data concepts to OMOP concepts.
        ii. Start with the most frequently used codes and determine your threshold of code frequency to include in the mapping.
        iii. Focus on a particular project or clinical domain to limit the scope of data needed for capture and conversion to OMOP.
        iv. Utilize the Usagi tool for mapping suggestions and searching based on similarity of code descriptions.

4.  **OMOPify your data!**

    a.  Determine the technology and software used or approved at your site for data storage, querying, and transfer. Determine the tools and technologies that team members and internal staff have expertise in.
    b.  Generate the OMOP DDLs
        i.  Using R: https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel
        ii. Using SQL: https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/tree/v5.4.0/inst/ddl/5.4
    c.  Implement the ETL.
        i.  Assign this task to the ETL team members with technical knowledge and permission for accessing and extracting source data and writing to a database.
        ii. Many tools and technologies can be used for this step. Utilize the existing tools, technologies, and expertise of your ETL team and internal staff.

5.  **Evaluate your data.**

    a.  Involve everyone in the evaluation and maintenance of ETL and data quality.
    b.  Review the ETL design documentation, computer code used in implementation, and concept mappings
    c.  Perform a manual audit using a sample of patients from both source data and derived OMOP data
    d.  Compare summary level counts of key fields between source data and OMOP derived data. (tools: Achilles)

**OMOP Cohort Creation and Deidentification Process:**

#### [01 -- Cohort Creation Script]{.underline}

**Filename**: [01_CURE_ID_Cohort.sql](https://github.com/OHDSI/CureIdRegistry/blob/main/Cohort%20curation%20scripts/01_CURE_ID_Cohort.sql)

**Purpose**: This script creates a cohort of patients for the CURE ID registry. The patient list is saved in the cohort table, along with other useful data elements.

**Description**: This SQL script creates a cohort of COVID-positive hospitalized patients based on specific criteria. The script performs several steps to identify and filter the patients before finally creating the cohort table. The script sets the context to use a specific database, but the actual name of the database is meant to be provided by the user.

**Steps**:

1)Â Â Â Â Â  Create cohort table.

2)Â Â Â Â Â  Identify patients (inpatient and outpatient) with covid positive lab results

a.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Use OMOP concepts that represent the LOINC codes for SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid test

b.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The concept ids here represent LOINC or SNOMED codes for standard ways to code a lab that is positive.

3)Â Â Â Â Â  Identify the first positive covid test per patient (after January 1, 2020).

4)Â Â Â Â Â  Limit to covid-positive patients with inpatient encounters.

5)Â Â Â Â Â  Apply all inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify all patients hospitalized with symptomatic covid-19 up to 21 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or up to 7 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test

6)Â Â Â Â Â  Find the closest inpatient encounter to first positive SARS-COV-2 test (for patients hospitalized more than once)

7)Â Â Â Â Â  Account for edge cases where patients have two hospitalizations same number of absolute days from SARS-COV-2 test (Ex: Patient hospitalized separately 3 days before and 3 days after SARS-COV-2 test)

8)Â Â Â Â Â  Create the cohort by adding on birth date and death date

#### [02 -- CURE ID Tables Script]{.underline}

**Purpose**: Replace conditions occurring 10 or less times in the dataset with parent concepts that have at least 10 counts

**Dependencies**: This script requires the cohort table built from 01_CURE_ID_Cohort.sql, and the data loaded into the Condition Occurrence table built from 02_CURE_ID_All_Tables.sql.

**Steps**:

1)Â Â Â Â Â  Condition roll up: concepts are mapped to their corresponding ancestor concept(s)

2)Â Â Â Â Â  Create table that counts the ancestor concepts for each original concept

3)Â Â Â Â Â  Create table that counts the original concepts

**Filename**: [05_DE_ID_script.sql](https://github.com/OHDSI/CureIdRegistry/blob/main/Cohort%20curation%20scripts/05_DE_ID_script.sql)

**Purpose**: This script creates a copy of the Cohort and removes identifying characteristics to prepare the data for sharing with the VIRUS registry.

**Dependencies**: This script requires the cohort table built from 01_CURE_ID_Cohort.sql, and the data loaded into all tables built from 02_CURE_ID_All_Tables.sql, rare conditions replace from 03_CURE_ID_replace_rare_conditions_with_parents.sql, and the de-identified OMOP CDM tables generated from 04_DE_ID_CDM_Table_ddl.sql.

**Description**: Run this file to generate a deidentified copy of your target data. Insert your data into the OMOP tables, and de-identify person_id, and date fields using date.shift. (\*If a person is 90 years of age or older, assign a random age between 90-99 years.)

**Steps**:

1)Â Â Â Â Â  Use find and replace to set source and target DB and Schema names

2)Â Â Â Â Â  Load the OMOP Person table, and de-identify

9)Â Â Â Â Â  Load the OMOP Device Exposure table, and de-identify

10)Â Â  Load the OMOP Measurement table, and de-identify

Reassignment of Person IDs:

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Person IDs are regenerated sequentially from a sorted copy of the Person table. These new Person IDs are carried throughout the CDM to all tables that reference it.

Date Shifting:

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Each person is assigned a random date shift value between -186 and +186 days. All dates for that person are then shifted shifted by that amount.

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Birthdays: After date shifting a person's birthday, the day is then set to the first of the new birth month. If the person would be \> 89 years old then they are assigned a random birth year that would make them 90-99 years old.

Date Truncation:

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A user-defined Start and End date are used to exclude any date shifted data that falls outside of the target date range (E.G. Procedures, conditions occurrences, etc. Does not include Birthdates).

Removal of other identifiers:

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Other potentially identifying datapoints are removed from the dataset such as location_id, provider_id, and care_site_id

## OMOP Table and Field Basics

Adapted from OHDSI CDM Site: [Data Model Conventions](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/dataModelConventions.html)Â 

#### Tables

For the tables of the main domains of the CDM it is imperative that concepts used are strictly limited to the domain. For example, the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table contains only information about conditions (diagnoses, signs, symptoms), but no information about procedures. Not all source coding schemes adhere to such rules. For example, ICD-9-CM codes, which contain mostly diagnoses of human disease, also contain information about the status of patients having received a procedure. The ICD-9-CM code V20.3 'Newborn health supervision' defines a continuous procedure and is therefore stored in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table.

| **Notation**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| \_SOURCE_VALUE      | Verbatim information from the source data, typically used in ETL to map to CONCEPT_ID, and not to be used by any standard analytics. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE = '787.02' was the ICD-9 code captured as a diagnosis from the administrative claim.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| \_ID                | Unique identifiers for key entities, which can serve as foreign keys to establish relationships across entities. For example, PERSON_ID uniquely identifies each individual. VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID uniquely identifies a PERSON encounter at a point of care.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| \_CONCEPT_ID        | Foreign key into the Standardized Vocabularies (i.e. the standard_concept attribute for the corresponding term is true), which serves as the primary basis for all standardized analytics. For example, CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID = [31967](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/31967) contains the reference value for the SNOMED concept of 'Nausea'                                                                                          |
| \_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID | Foreign key into the Standardized Vocabularies representing the concept and terminology used in the source data, when applicable. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID = [45431665](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45431665) denotes the concept of 'Nausea' in the Read terminology; the analogous CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID might be 31967, since SNOMED-CT is the Standardized Vocabulary for most clinical diagnoses and findings. |
| \_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID   | Delineates the origin of the source information, standardized within the Standardized Vocabularies. For example, DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can allow analysts to discriminate between 'Pharmacy dispensing' and 'Prescription written                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Cure ID Concept Mapping Support

![](images/CureID_Concept_Mapping_Process.png)

#### Collaborative OMOP Concept Mapping Process

1.  CureID clinical informaticists work with each site to manually map internal concepts to OMOP concepts outlined for capture in the project plan.

2.  The combined concepts from all sites are maintained as a single, updated concept set using the OHDSI ATLAS open-source tool.

3.  All concepts currently identified by the work between CureID staff and each site, and all corresponding descendant concepts are exported from ATLAS as .json or .csv files for use in cohort creation, profiling, and clinical registry submission.

# Geocoding and Integrating SDOH Data

Geocoding

The primary consideration for linking geospatial data like social determinants of health and environmental risk factors with patient data is protecting PHI when geocoding patient home address and location data. Do not use web-based API services for geocoding as they require patient addresses to be sent to an external server for batch geocoding.

# OHDSI Tool Suite

The Edge Tool Suite are a set of OHDSI tools that should be deployed by the site that provide value around the OMOP CDM. This work was funded by the CURE ID initiative <https://cure.ncats.io>

The OHDSI open source software configured for deployment include:

-   The Atlas data science platform

-   The WebAPI backed for Atlas

-   The HADES statistical analysis packages

-   The Data Quality Dashboard

-   The Perseus ETL management system

#### Simplifying the ETL process

The OHDSI community has created a series of individual software packages to facilitate the ETL from proprietary EHRs to OMOP, evaluate data quality, define cohorts, and perform analyses. The "Edge Tool" packages these individual tools to facilitate the performance of an OMOP ETL and subsequent use of the data for defining cohorts for observational research. In contrast to registry approaches which ingest data represented in various data models and perform data harmonization centrally, software components of the "Edge Tool" facilitate ETL performance locally at the "edge." This suite of software aims to drastically reduce the labor and effort required to go from "zero to OMOP." We anticipate that institutions that use the full suite of offered software will be able to reduce the person-hours required for an OMOP ETL to as little as 50 hours.

#### Software components

The Edge Tool encompasses the Perseus ETL management solution, the HADES R analysis package within an RStudio Server R integrated development environment, and the ATLAS cohort discovery tool with WebAPI web services integration (Figure). The Perseus graphic-user interface (GUI) approach provides source-to-concept mapping for the ETL, with assisted extraction of data from EHR such as flowsheets (vital signs, nursing assessments), test measurements, and diagnoses. Rather than performing a series of SQL queries with wildcards to identify data elements of interest from primary source EHR tables,users may enter desired data element terms into a browser text field which are then matched using term similarity to source table entries.Users may then evaluate the completeness and quality of the ETL using the Data Quality Dashboard which performs \>3,000 individual data quality checks on the OMOP-formatted data and is reported through a web-based reporting system.

In tandem with Perseus, OHDSI HADES and OHDSI ATLAS are the two projects within the Edge Tool that allow for advanced analysis once data has been harmonized with the OMOP CDM, such as generating cohorts for research, patient level prediction, treatment pathways, large scale population analytics, automated reporting and, optionally, participation in OHDSI network studies.The OHDSI applications within the Edge Tool have been containerized using OHDSI Broadsea, allowing for even easier deployment. Current use of the Edge Tool has proven promising and while limitations still exist - e.g., not currently capable of extracting data from unstructured fields such as notes or loose text - further process optimization and tool development will reduce this implementation time and effort further.

# Best Practices

Data Quality Dos and Don'ts

-   Do install the Data Quality Dashboard early on in the process.

-   Don't include source values in your export.- they might include PHI.

-   Don't forget to check GitHub for the most recent version of the script before you run it.

-   Don't send your data to the coordinating center until the tech team has a chance to review it with you in a live session.

### Commonly Used CDM Tables Overview
The OMOP common data model (CDM) is a relational database made up of different tables that relate to each other by foreign keys (XXXX_ID values; e.g., PERSON_ID or PROVIDER_ID). The OMOP tables in your data export are as follows:

| Table              | Description |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Person             | Contains basic demographic information describing a participant, including biological sex, birth date, race, and ethnicity. |
| Visit_occurrence   | Captures encounters with healthcare providers or similar events. Contains the type of visit a person has (outpatient care, inpatient care, or long-term care), as well as the date and duration information. Rows in other tables can reference this table, for example, condition_occurrences related to a specific visit. |
| Condition_occurrence | Indicates the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or symptom, which is either observed by a provider or reported by the patient. |
| Drug_exposure      | Captures records about the utilization of a medication. Drug exposures include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as drugs. Drug exposure is inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensing, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information. |
| Measurement        | Contains both orders and results of a systematic and standardized examination or testing of a participant or participant's sample, including laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. |
| Procedure_occurrence | Contains records of activities or processes ordered by or carried out by a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. |
| Observation        | Captures clinical facts about a person obtained in the context of an examination, questioning, or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by another domain, such as social and lifestyle facts, medical history, and family history, are recorded here. |
| Device_exposure    | Captures information about a person's exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Devices include implantable objects, blood transfusions, medical equipment and supplies, other instruments used in medical procedures, and material used in clinical care. |
| Death              | Contains the clinical events surrounding how and when a participant dies. |

### ETL Steps 
1. **Dataset profiling and documentation**
    - Create data model documentation, sample data, data dictionaries, code lists, and other relevant information (23-Aug)
    - Execute database profiling scan (WhiteRabbit) on source database
    - Prepare mapping approach/documents based on scan reports from database profiling scan

2. **Generation of the ETL Design**
    - Mapping workshop with all relevant parties to:
        1. Understand the source
        2. Define the scope of source data to be transformed
        3. Define acceptance criteria for OMOP output
        - Output: draft mapping document
    - Finalize mapping document:
        - Integrate all notes/documentation from workshop
        - Work through mappings and verify, update, fill in gaps
        - Meetings/emails with data contact/technical contact (TC) as needed

3. **Source Data Integrations and Semantic Mapping**
    - Source Code mapping:
        - Identify which codes are already mapped to standard vocabulary
        - Identify code types for codes that need to be mapped
        - Translation of code description/phrases to English, if/as needed
        - Create proposed code mappings
    - Generate mappings for data coming out of flowsheets (together with consortium)
    - Review/approval of code mappings, often done by medical experts affiliated with Data Owner (DO). 
    - Identify medical imaging available and define mappings to Imaging Extension
    - Identify waveform data available and map using consortium-defined guidelines
    - Use OHNLP to extract OMOP data from unstructured sources

4. **Technical architecture design**
    - Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
        - Decide on ETL dev/deployment flow
        - Put version control mechanisms in place
    - OHDSI Ecosystem:
        - Evaluate infrastructure needed
        - Create infrastructure design documentation

5. **Technical ETL Development**
    - Implement ETL (Preferred Language/Structure?)
    - Update ETL based on testing/QA/feedback (8, 9)

6. **Setting up of Infrastructure**
    - Deploy core servers and associated services based on infrastructure design in (4)

7. **Installation of the OHDSI tools**
    - Install and configure all software (database server, Achilles/DQD/Ares, Atlas/WebAPI, R Studio server, HADES, notebooks/tooling related to analytics, and any other software to suit a siteâs specific needs).

8. **ETL Testing and Validation**
    - ETL Execution:
        - Test ETL using sample/development data (with limited external data access)
        - Test ETL using DO data (with full external data access)
        - Verify and document QA
        - Submit Achilles/DQD/AresIndexer results to central location regularly
    - ETL Development Planning and Management:
        - Review ETL testing and progress (TCs/meetings)

9. **Data Quality Assessment**
    - QA/Acceptance testing:
        - Evaluate accuracy and completeness of mapping
        - Review and approval by DO

10. **Documentation**
    - Mapping Documentation and Themis Checks
    - Transformation/Technical Documentation

11. **Project Management Througout**
    - Organization of tasks, milestones, and follow-up
